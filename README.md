# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews  
*A symphony of code and emotion*

---

## 🌟 Overview

This project unveils a machine learning model that deciphers the emotional tone behind movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. Whether a film evoked tears of joy or sighs of regret, our model listens to every word, learns from sentiment, and predicts with poetic precision.

Using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm and **TF-IDF vectorization**, we transform raw human expressions into quantified insights.

## 🧠 Features

- 📚 Preprocessing: Cleans text using regex, lowercasing, and NLTK stopwords  
- 🧮 Vectorization: Applies TF-IDF to transform text to numeric form  
- 🧪 Model Training: Trains a Naive Bayes classifier using scikit-learn  
- 📊 Evaluation: Displays accuracy and classification metrics  
- 🧾 Custom Testing: Analyze your own movie review and predict its sentiment

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

### 📥 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-imdb.git
cd sentiment-analysis-imdb
````

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📂 Prepare the Dataset

Download the IMDB dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
Place the CSV file in the same directory as `sentiment_analysis.py` and rename it to:

```
IMDB Dataset.csv
```

---

## 🧪 Run the Project

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

The script will:

* Load and preprocess the data
* Train the model
* Print accuracy and a classification report
* Predict the sentiment of a sample review

## 📌 Example Output

```
Accuracy: 0.87
Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
...
New Review: the movie great loved
Predicted Sentiment: Positive
```
